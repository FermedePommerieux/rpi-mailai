# Agent Instructions

- Preserve the existing rich documentation (docstrings and detailed comments) when modifying Python code.
- Keep all operator-facing documentation in English to remain consistent across the repository.
- After Python changes, run at least `python -m compileall app` to check for syntax errors.
